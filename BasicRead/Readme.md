This project demonstrates reading a table from both SQL-Server and MS-Access where both tables have the exact same fields. There is a class for MS-Access and a class for SQL-Server were both return a DataTable to populate one DataGridView per database.

The main difference between both operations are a) the connection string b) the data provider, OleDb and SqlClient. 

In later demonstrations code will be optimize at various levels.
